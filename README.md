### 💡 Featured Projects
- 🧠 [Lean Theorem Prover – Real Analysis Proofs](https://github.com/manasa7958/lean-oscillatory)  
  Formalized theorems like Van der Corput’s Lemma using Lean 4, applied to proof verification and real analysis models.

- 🧬 [Nanopore Tumor Classification Pipeline (Dana-Farber)](https://github.com/manasa7958/dfci_internship_summary)
  Designed and automated a sequencing analysis pipeline reducing runtime from 30 to 5 minutes; classified CNS tumors using machine learning.

- 🔧 [Kronos Log Parser (C++)](https://github.com/manasa7958/Projects)  
  Parsed system logs with Boost.Regex for millisecond-accurate performance tracking and uptime monitoring.

- 🧬 [DNA Sequence Aligner (Hirschberg’s Algorithm)](https://github.com/manasa7958/Projects)  
  Reduced memory usage by 99% on 100K+ base alignments using space-optimized divide-and-conquer algorithm.

- 🎲 [Random Writer – Markov Model (C++)](https://github.com/manasa7958/Projects)  
  Generated synthetic text using character-level Markov chains trained on 6K+ line datasets for statistical modeling.

- 🚀 [GPU Usage Visualizer (Python)](https://github.com/manasa7958/gpu-usage-visualizer) *(in progress)*  
  Python tool using NVIDIA’s pynvml API to track GPU usage, temperature, and memory in real time via CLI.
